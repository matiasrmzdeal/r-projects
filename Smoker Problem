Description of question from econ stats problem set:

Maternal smoking during pregnancy has an negative association with birthweight. Sup-
pose that the distribution of newborn child’s birthweight is BWS ∼ N (3050, 5902) if
the mother smokes during pregnancy, while the distribution is BSN S ∼ N (3260, 5302)
if the mother does not smoke during pregnancy.

(a) Which of the following is larger: the pdf of BWS evaluated at 3050 or the pdf of
BWN S evaluated at 3260? Explain why.

(b) Plot the two distributions on the same graph, over the range between 2000 grams
and 4500 grams, in R.

(d) What is the probability that the birthweight of a baby born to a smoking mother
is greater than the birthweight of a baby born to the non-smoking mother? (You
can treat these two births as independent of each other.)
